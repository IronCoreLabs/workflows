# This workflow does version management, bumping the patch version on the main branch after a PR is merged.

# Requirements:
# - It needs a GitHub secret named WORKFLOW_PAT with a personal access token that has workflow permissions. The user that owns the
#   PAT must be allowed to push to the main branch of the repo. That usually means the user has to be a repo admin, and admins must
#   be excepted from branch protection rules on main.
# - Another workflow must consume the prereleases created by this one. That workflow should build and publish the release.

# Terminology:
# - In semver, everything before the optional "-" is the version, and everything after it is the prerelease version.
# - In this workflow, we can operate on the release part of the semver, or on the prerelease part of the semver.
# - In GitHub, we create a "release" object that can optionally have the "prerelease" flag set to true. The "docker.yaml" workflow
#   triggers on release events.
# I'm sorry the terminology is bad.

# Customize:
# It can work in either release mode or prerelease mode. That controls whether it increments the release version or the prerelease
# version. Here's an example of how the two modes transform the current version into the release version and bumped version:
# | mode    | release     | prerelease  |
# | current | 1.2.3-pre   | 1.2.3-pre.4 |
# | release | 1.2.3       | 1.2.3-rc.4  |
# | bumped  | 1.2.4-pre   | 1.2.3-pre.5 |
# The default mode is "release". To get "prerelease" mode, modify /env/MODE.

# Details:
# This workflow is triggered by merge to main, or by manual workflow_dispatch.
# 1. Make a release version. Depending on whether we're in "release" or "prerelease" mode:
#    - release: Remove the -prerelease info from the semver. (1.2.3-pre -> 1.2.3)
#    - prerelease: Remove any non-numeric characters from the prerelease part of the semver. (1.2.3-pre.4 -> 1.2.3-4)
# 2. Commit, push, tag, and create a GitHub prerelease.
# 3. Bump the version, and add `-pre` or `.pre` as a pre-release identifier.
#    - release: 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4-pre
#    - prerelease: 1.2.3-4 -> 1.2.3-pre.5
# 4. Commit and push.
# It parses the version info from files in the repo like Cargo.toml, package.json, or version.sbt. It updates those files when it
# bumps the version.
# Sanity checks ensure it's a valid semver, and it's not 0.0.0.
